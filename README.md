## Description

_ In section 1.3 one had to write a program to see if a baby would live one billion seconds, therefore converting seconds into years. 
  In section 1.6 one had to write a program for the amount of money after an interest 3 years later.
  In section 1.9 one had to fix syntax errors written in the code.  


<Give a description of the assignment here. Often this will be copied from the text.\>_

## What I Learned from This

_ In these sections I learned how to print something with both the variable in words and what it represents in numbers. I also learned alot of syntax from fixing errors in section 1.9.
